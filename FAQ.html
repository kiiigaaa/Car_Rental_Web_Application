      <p class = " text ">Each person who intends to drive must bring a valid driver's license to drive in Japan, passport, and a valid means of
         payment (generally via credit card). All of these items must be submitted

              <p class = " text "> Yes. No restrictions are placed on the date of issuance of the driver’s license. We have a large-scale compensation system that
                 beginner drivers can use to rent a 
                vehicle without worries. People with little confidence in their driving skills are also welcome to use our services.
